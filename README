Various ZSH completion scripts. These require http://www.zsh.org/ and must be
located in a $fpath directory. For example, a custom directory could be used
via ~/.zshrc settings such as:

  # custom dir for completions, plus the vendor default ones
  fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)

  # turn on the completion system
  autoload -U compinit && compinit

(Some folks change $fpath after the autoload, then wonder why things "do
not work.")

  or try #zsh on the Freenode IRC network. (Do *not* use OMZ. It is
  buggy baggage. (Or any other shell "framework" that you do not
  understand.))

* Many of the completions here are for utilities under:

  or one or the other of my Perl modules (see github, CPAN).
