Various ZSH completion scripts. These require http://www.zsh.org/ and
must be located in a $fpath directory, for example under
~/.zsh/functions via the following in the ~/.zshrc config file:

  fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)

* For more info on ZSH completion, consult:

  http://bewatermyfriend.org/p/2012/003/

  or try #zsh on the Freenode IRC network (where we will likely point
  you at the above and other docs).

* Even more completion scripts can be found under:

  http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Arc/git.html
  https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/

* Many of the completions here are for utilities under:

  https://github.com/thrig/sial.org-scripts

  or one or the other of my Perl modules.
